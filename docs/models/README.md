# Models

Descriptions of what IS: architecture overviews, data-flow maps, subsystem descriptions.

- **Authoring bar:** every volatile claim carries a `verify:` command — a Model without one
  drifts silently (the most-reproduced defect in the DRP corpus review).
- **Written by:** human; the codemap (`_tkr_kit/codemap.yml`) is the machine-maintained Model.
- **Retention:** bounded — replace-on-write; a Model of a torn-down system is deleted, not kept.
