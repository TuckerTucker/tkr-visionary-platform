# Visionary

A single-user LoRA training and generation platform on Modal. `modal deploy app.py`
gives you one URL that is the whole application — UI, API and GPU jobs.

## Philosophy

Three words, in priority order when they conflict. Each expands in
`.claude/rules/backend.md`, with the failures that produced it.

**Antifragile.** A failure should teach you something and leave the system
better able to survive the next one. Errors carry the three facts that
distinguish the causes; any error a user can hit twice should have explained
itself the first time. Destructive is asked for, not softened — the confirm
dialog states the blast radius. A wait costs what it shows, not what it takes:
forty minutes of visible work is comfortable, sixty seconds of a still button is
not, so the lever on a slow path is almost never *make it faster*, it is **say
what it is doing**, and say something different as often as the thing itself
changes. Stops are cooperative, and a cooperative stop has to be readable and
read.

**Scalable.** Not requests per second — dataset size, model size, and cost per
job. Never rent a GPU to do CPU work. Keep the polled thing small, and let a
poll wait for its own reply rather than fire on a clock. Separate storage by
commit cost. One container per loaded checkpoint.

**Future-proof.** Prefer the surface that will still be there, and that carries
the *next* model in for free. Depend on maintained upstreams over owned forks.
Separate images when pins conflict — and only then.

### The user's prose is the record; everything derived from it is a receipt

This survived the deletion of everything that was built to serve it, which is
the strongest thing that can be said for it.

> **What a model produces from somebody's sentence is a derived, disposable
> interpretation. The sentence is the record.**

*Derived*: regenerable at any time. *Disposable*: refusable whole, at any point,
with no loss beyond an interpretation. That is the relationship between
`prompt_typed` and the compiled `prompt` — intent is what is kept, everything
downstream of it is a receipt. Reuse, Copy and the metadata sheet prefer the
typed one.

It pays off the moment a model is replaced: intent recompiles for whatever comes
next, while a stored prompt is worth nothing to a checkpoint that wants a
different grammar.

**A prompt is a compilation target, not something the user writes.** Nobody
should have to learn a text encoder. The user says what they want; the app knows
what each model needs; the prompt is an implementation detail they should never
have to see. Fragments are the expected input, not the degraded case — out of
order, incomplete, self-correcting. A tool that demands one clean flowing
paragraph is demanding that a human produce the artefact of a machine before the
machine will listen.

**The unit of authorship must not be transferable.** A prompt fails that test
precisely *because* it copies whole — paste the string, get the look, bring no
taste. A LoRA passes because it is not a string, and so does a set of your own
photographs. So nothing here browses, searches or recommends somebody else's
instruments — weights, reference sets, character bibles, style packs, or
whatever the next format is called. Pulling a specific file you were sent is
fine; that is what the Drive route is for. A marketplace is not, whatever it is
a marketplace *of*.

The full argument, and the veto list it produces, is in `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Hard rules

These apply before any file is opened. Everything else is scoped — see Pointers
below.

- **Comments explain why, not what.** Every non-obvious line in this codebase
  earns its comment by naming the failure that produced it. If a comment could
  be deleted without losing a fact, delete it.
- **No `from __future__ import annotations`.** It broke FastAPI's
  `get_type_hints()` against module globals and turned `/api/upload` into a 422.
  See the note at the top of `app.py`.
- **No Modal Secrets, no CLI setup.** Both credentials — the deployment's
  password and the HF token — are typed into the UI and stored in Modal Dicts.
  `modal deploy app.py` is the entire install, and that is what made
  trust-on-first-use the bootstrap for the password: there is no step at which
  one could have been supplied.
- **Every route is behind the password unless the allowlist says otherwise.**
  The gate is one middleware on the ASGI app, so a new route is protected by
  existing. `OPEN_PATHS` is two entries and should stay two. See Conventions in
  `.claude/rules/backend.md` for why it is a cookie, why it is verified with
  arithmetic rather than a lookup, and how a forgotten password is recovered.
- **Nothing downloads on its own.** Weights are chosen explicitly, under the
  gear.
- **Pin to what you can reproduce.** A commit SHA, not a branch or a floating
  ref. When upstream force-pushes, your build should not change under you.
- **Storage layout is the contract, not the code.** Datasets are folders of
  images with `.txt` sidecars beside them — the same thing the trainer reads.
  Nothing here is required to get your data back out.
- **Do not build a second way to do the first thing.** New capability extends
  the existing job/status/stop contract rather than inventing a parallel one.
- **A reader that drops a field makes every run that has one unreadable.** A
  sidecar is read years after it is written, so a field nothing fills any more
  still gets written and still gets read.
- **Prose, not tags.** Captions are sentences, because the text encoders these
  models use parse grammar. See the `CAPTION_MODELS` comment.
- **Arithmetic in the validator, judgement in the harness.** The validator runs
  on every request and gates a render, so what belongs there are structural
  zeros — a probabilistic gate stacked on a probabilistic writer is two coin
  flips where the second one is invisible. Judgement goes where latency is free.
- **`app.py` is deliberately one file**, navigable by its banner comments. The
  alternative trades one long file for a build-order problem in the Modal image
  builds.

## Pointers

| Where | What it holds | Loads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/rules/backend.md` | `app.py`, the ComfyUI nodes, the tools: the philosophy in detail, storage behaviour, conventions, the shot vocabulary | on reading `app.py`, `comfy_nodes/**`, `tools/**` |
| `web/CLAUDE.md` | the page, the console budget, the canvas, region cards, LoRA chips, the shot palette, the scene composer, and the veto list | on reading anything under `web/` |
| `docs/decisions.md` | what was removed or refused, and the measurement that settled it — the semantic layer, the rewrite, `forge/`, Wan 2.2, 2K, the ten-minute render | never; read it when someone proposes rebuilding one |
| `docs/roadmap.md` | the phases, and the veto list in full | never; read it when deciding whether a new surface belongs |

Layout and the storage schema are not written down here because they are
readable: `ls`, and `app.py` around the `WORKSPACE` constants. What is written
down is why they are shaped that way, in the rules files above.

**The front end is built into the image, not mounted from your disk.** That is
what keeps `modal deploy app.py` the entire install. Node is a build-time
dependency of the image; nothing at runtime needs it.

## Documentation discipline

- Do not create .md files unless I explicitly ask for one.
- Never write session artifacts: no PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, PHASE_*.md,
  *_COMPLETE.md, MIGRATION_NOTES.md, IMPLEMENTATION_*.md. Report that in chat.
- Docs live in exactly three places: README.md, CLAUDE.md, and docs/.
  Nothing else at repo root.
- If a change affects something already documented, edit the existing file.
  Do not add a new one alongside it.
- Before writing any .md, state which existing doc you considered editing instead.
