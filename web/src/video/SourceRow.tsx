/**
 * Every picture the model can be given, in one row — and the two halves dim each
 * other.
 *
 * Keyframes and references are the same decision made two ways. They load different
 * transformers, so one excludes the other, and they used to be two rows: keyframes
 * parked at the right of the strip among the numeric controls, references in their own
 * row below. Two pairs of unlabelled 36px dashed tiles, one row apart, telling each
 * other apart by tooltip.
 *
 * What that cost was not tidiness. The keyframe tiles were never found at all, and
 * dropping photos into the reference tray *looked* like filling keyframe slots that
 * kept growing — which is exactly what the tray does and exactly what a fixed pair
 * must never look like. Side by side with a rule between them, the tray that grows and
 * the two slots that do not are told apart by shape, which is the thing a tooltip
 * could not do.
 *
 * Whichever half is out of play goes dim rather than disappearing: the row's job is to
 * show that these are alternatives, and a control that vanishes when you fill its
 * neighbour teaches nothing except that the page lost it. **References win when both
 * are attached**, because that is what the run does, so they are the half that stays
 * live — dimming both, which the symmetric version did, left the gallery's "As
 * reference" hand-off in a state where a keyframe could not be cleared and a second
 * reference could not be added: the two controls locked each other out.
