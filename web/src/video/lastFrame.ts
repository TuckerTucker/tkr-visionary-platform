 * not need to do it.** A scene longer than one generation is several generations
 * — H3 tops out at `H3_MAX_FRAMES`, 345 at 24fps, so about 14.4 seconds — and the
 * thing that makes them read as one continuous scene rather than as unrelated
 * clips is that the next one opens where the last one stopped. `first_frame`
 * already exists on `/api/video` and already promotes the task to `i2va`; nothing
 * was ever handing it a frame.
 *
 * Client-side on purpose. The bytes are already on the volume and already served
 * to a `<video>` on the canvas, so a route that decoded a frame server-side would
 * be a GPU-adjacent container doing work a decoder in the page does for free —
 * which is the "never rent a GPU to do CPU work" rule one step further out.
 *
 * `seekable.end` rather than `duration`: a fragmented MP4 can report `Infinity`
 * for the latter before the whole file is buffered, and seeking to `Infinity`
 * resolves to nothing and hangs the promise. A sixteenth of a second back from
 * the end, because seeking exactly to it lands past the final sample on some
 * decoders and paints black.
