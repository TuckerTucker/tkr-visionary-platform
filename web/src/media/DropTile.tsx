/**
 * A 32px tile that takes one picture: a keyframe, a plate, or a region's photo.
 *
 * **`can-drop` is set here rather than written into the markup**, so the class that
 * makes a target glow is applied by the same component that gives it a handler.
 * That is the fault this was written for: the reference tray never had a drop
 * handler at all — it was a click-only picker sitting in a row of tiles that all
 * take drops, and the drag-intent reveal then lit it like the rest. A control that
 * lights up under a dragged file and refuses it is worse than one that stays dark:
 * the dark one is undiscovered, the lit one is a promise the page breaks while you
 * watch.
 *
 * A second click on a filled tile clears it. There is no ✕ because the tile is 32px
 * and a hit target inside it would be smaller than a fingertip. Keyframes could be
 * *replaced* but never removed for a while, so the only route back to
 * text-to-video was switching model and back — harmless while the two halves were
 * unrelated rows, and a corner you cannot get out of now that a keyframe puts the
 * reference tray out of play.
 *
 * `locked` is visible and hoverable so it can say why, which means it is also
 * clickable and droppable unless every entry point checks — a locked tile that
 * opened a file picker and then swallowed the picture would be worse than the
 * hidden tile that preceded it.
