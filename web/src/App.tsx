 * The shell: header, stage, canvas, console.

 * it byte for byte and selects on `.top`, `.views`, `.stage`, `.canvas`, `.console` and
 * `.field`. UI_HTML is deleted and the stylesheet is the source now, so new rules are
 * written here like anywhere else — but renaming one of those classes still costs a
 * rewrite of the block that measures against it, which is the expensive part.
 *
 * **Generate is the page, not a destination.** It has no nav item; the wordmark is how you
 * get back to it. Train is one door, labelled with where it leads rather than where you
 * are, so two things never look equally selected — and it carries the training run's
 * progress, because a run lasts hours and you are meant to leave and keep working.

     gear and the weights appear" is that bug wearing a workaround.

     What comes back wrong is a listing that says the volume holds nothing while it holds
     26 GB of Krea 2 — seen once against a real deployment, with `/api/state` fetched from
     that same page reporting `turbo.present: true` a moment later, and not reproducible
     on demand. The cause is below us: `_sizes_on_disk` reads a directory rather than
     statting each file *because* a failed lookup is cached under the mount, and a readdir
     that lands before the mount has caught up is the same fault one level up.

     So this re-checks rather than diagnoses. Bounded at three attempts, and only while
     the answer is still "there is no DiT here" — the one state that is both the symptom

 * and saying so beside them is saying it where the loss would be.
