/**
 * Putting a finished run back in the composer.
 *
 * The point of keeping the sidecar: everything here reproduces the result, so this is a
 * read of a file rather than a re-typed prompt.
 *
 * **The pills come back, not the sentence they compiled into.** A run whose prompt was a
 * six-field document has to be restored as the rail that built it — putting the document
 * into the prompt box would put a schema in a textarea and then compile *that* on the
 * next run, which is the one way this feature could corrupt a reuse. `shot` is only in
 * the sidecar when the compiler did something, so a card from before the palette existed
 * clears the rail rather than keeping whatever happened to be on it.
