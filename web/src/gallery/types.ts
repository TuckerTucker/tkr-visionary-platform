 * interchangeable. `prompt` is the compiled receipt: what this encoder was
 * told, this once. `prompt_typed` and `shot` are the durable half — what you
 * actually meant.
 *
 * **A card never shows any of them.** The grid carries the picture, its kind
 * and its age; the prompt lives in the metadata sheet, and Reuse and Copy read
 * it from there. Worth stating because "put the prompt on the card" is an
 * obvious-looking addition, and it is the wrong one twice over: a six-field H3
 * document is not a thing you can read at thumbnail size, and a prompt is an
 * implementation detail of whichever encoder was being fed that day.
 *
 * Where the prompt *is* shown — the sheet, Reuse, Copy — the typed one wins.
 * That reads as legibility and is really the deeper choice: intent recompiles
 * for whatever model comes next, while a stored prompt is worth nothing to a
 * checkpoint that wants a different grammar.
