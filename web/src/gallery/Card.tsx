/**
 * One generation in a grid.
 *
 * The cover is `contain`, never `cover`, on desktop — a ragged grid is the
 * right trade because cropping throws away the thing you opened the gallery to
 * see. The stylesheet handles that; the only reason it is worth repeating here
 * is that "tidy the grid" is a change somebody will want to make.
 *
 * `contain` inside a fixed 4:3 box is what that used to mean, and the bars it
 * left were the cost of keeping the grid square-shouldered. On desktop the box
 * is now the picture's own shape and the cards are packed into columns, so
 * nothing is letterboxed and nothing is cropped — see `Masonry`. Below 1024px
 * the square crop stays, deliberately.
 *
 * The picture is `/api/cover`, not `/api/file`: see `coverOf`. The viewer gets the
 * original, which is where full resolution is the whole point.
 *
 * There is no hover cluster over the picture any more. Download and Delete sat there and
 * again in the ⋯ menu underneath — the only actions in the app with two doors, and the
 * two doors disagreed about what a card can do: the cluster held two verbs, the menu
 * holds six, including reuse, which is the reason the sidecar is kept at all. One home,
 * and it is the menu, because that is the one that can hold the whole set. Opening is
 * untouched by this and never lived in the cluster — it has always been a click on the
 * picture itself.
