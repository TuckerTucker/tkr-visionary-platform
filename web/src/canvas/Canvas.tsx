/**
 * The largest thing on screen, always.
 *
 * Options live in a bar under it, never a rail beside it: a settings column costs the
 * picture 384px of the one dimension it cannot get back. That is measured — fitting
 * each render aspect into a 1512x982 canvas leaves 0px of dead vertical space at
 * *every* aspect and 152–1068px horizontal, so the picture is height-bound everywhere
 * and the bar always comes out of it.
 *
 * **One canvas at a time is the law.** A batch used to be a two-up contact sheet at half
 * height, and that is the arrangement that broke the regions: one set of boxes applies to
 * the whole batch, so there was no single surface to draw them on, and at four or eight
 * they landed on the first cell of the grid you were trying to judge. Now each result
 * fills the canvas and the strip slides between them like frames of film — `‹ 1 / 4 ›` is
 * the whole control. The one on screen *is* the canvas, which is also the surface an
 * inpaint would act on when there is one.
 *
 * **Where the boxes are drawn is decided here.** The current still wins over the frame,
 * because adjusting boxes against the picture you actually got is the point of them still
 * being reachable after a render; a plate wins over the still, because a plate is what
 * you are composing *into*, so the last render is no longer the subject. What is *drawn*
 * on that surface is `store.edit`'s business, not this file's — after a render the answer
 * is nothing at all.
 *
 * **One surface, two layers, and time is what picks between them.** A still is a
 * scene with no duration: the frame layer — the film strip below, or a lone clip —
 * draws it, and the engine is never asked for. Once the scene has time (a take on
 * the video side) the stage mounts in the same slot and draws the cut instead. That
 * is decided here and nowhere else, so there is one canvas rather than a second one
 * that happens to sit beside it: mounting Pixi for stills was the alternative and it
 * was refused, because the engine is 890 KB gzipped and "duration starts at zero"
 * vetoes making somebody who wants one image wait for it.
