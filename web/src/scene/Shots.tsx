 * byte-for-byte the prompt box it replaced, on the argument that a feature should
 * not announce itself before it is being used. The owner's reading of that,
 * verbatim: *"I don't even see a timeline."* Which is the same fault the icon
 * rule already names one layer down — a surface indistinguishable from the one it
 * replaced is a capability nobody can find, and the degrade it was protecting is
 * a fact about the *compiler*, not about what the page should look like. One shot
 * still compiles to the typed text byte-for-byte; it simply no longer pretends to
 * be a text box while doing it.
 *
 * **The rows divide the field's existing allowance rather than adding to it** —
 * one prompt at two lines and two shots at one line each are the same height, so
 * a four-shot scene costs what a long prompt costs. See `growRows`.
