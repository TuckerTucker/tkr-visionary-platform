/**
 * What a cast member is made of, disclosed only for the chip you touched.
 *
 * **It costs the console nothing.** A card rooted on its chip and floating over
 * the canvas, the way a region's card is rooted on its box — which is what makes
 * the depth affordable at all: five slots per member and eight members is a panel,
 * and a panel is the month-four failure Phase 6 names.
 *
 * **And it is a form, deliberately.** Labels, field edges, one row per thing you
 * can say about somebody. The first version stripped all of that on the "copy is
 * a last resort" instinct and it was the wrong rule to reach for: that one governs
 * a row you *scan*, and this is a thing you *fill in* — the same distinction that
 * keeps Train's edges while the console's controls lose theirs. A form without
 * field edges is a worse form. Unlabelled, it read as a request for five files.
 *
 * **Not a `Popover`, and a portal anyway.** Popover closes on scroll, which is
 * right for a menu and wrong for a box you type a name into — the objection
 * `LoraBox` records. But the console is `overflow:auto`, so a child of it floating
 * above its own top edge is clipped by the very rule that stops a full console
 * pushing the canvas out of frame. So: portalled and fixed, placed off the chip's
 * own rect, and closing on nothing but a press outside it or Escape.
