/**
 * What you have of a subject, and what each piece of it is for.
 *
 * **One row per reference, and one well that always takes the next file.** This
 * was a single well holding one photograph, which was the right correction to
 * five labelled squares and the wrong stopping point: the guide is explicit that
 * *"One subject may be defined by multiple reference assets, and one reference
 * asset may provide multiple subjects"*, and it writes the relationship as prose
 * rather than as a schema —
 *
 *     <Subject 1> is the woman whose appearance comes from <Picture 1> and whose
 *     walking motion comes from <Video 1>.
 *
 * So a second picture is not a second slot to invent a name for. It is another
 * row, with a field for the one thing only you know: what *this* one is for.
 *
 * **The two notes are different claims and the placeholders have to say so.**
 * `member.note` is what the subject *is* — the description the guide puts right
 * after the label. A `ref.note` is what one asset *provides*, and empty is the
 * ordinary case: an unnoted picture is referenced whole. The placeholder still
 * teaches on every row — *what to reference — face, clothing, style…* — because
 * a photograph lending part of itself is a capability nothing else on the page
 * can announce, and hiding it on the first row hid it where everyone starts.
 *
 * **The file decides the channel, and a file the subject cannot take never
 * lights the well.** Read off `dataTransfer.items` during the drag, which is the
 * one moment the answer is available and still useful — the rejection is the
 * absence of an invitation, and it is the only thing worth keeping from the five
 * squares this replaced.
