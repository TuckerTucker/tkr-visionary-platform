 * layer was one element moved between the frame and the first still with

 * features breaking: anything that replaced a container's innerHTML deleted it, and the
 * symptom was never "the layer is gone" — it was every caller of `drawRegions` dying at
 * its first statement, so the boxes vanished, the inspector would not close and the
 * Regional toggle appeared dead. Rendering it as a child of whichever host is showing
 * deletes the whole class of fault: React owns the placement, and `<Frame>` and the
 * first `.shot` each just include one.
 *
 * **The boxes belong to the still slot, not to a host.** A still is a zero-duration
 * scene of one slot, and `store.regions` is that slot's regions — so whichever host
 * shows the slot draws the same set, and a trip to the video side and back finds
 * them where they were. A video slot is never a host: `/api/video` takes no regions,
 * and the stage mounts `StageRegions` instead, which says so.
 *
 * Every coordinate in here is a percentage, so nothing measures the host. The drag
 * measures this element's own rect, which is the host's content box — `inset: 0` makes
 * those the same box on the frame, and `bottom: var(--acts-h)` is what keeps them the
 * same box on a still, where `.shot` reserves padding under the picture for its two
 * buttons.
 *
