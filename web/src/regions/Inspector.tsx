/**
 * The box, opened.
 *
 * A rectangle on screen can be 60px wide and what it holds needs about 280, so the
 * card cannot be the box — but it can be *rooted* in it, hanging off the box's near
 * edge and sharing its stroke, which is the difference between the object answering
 * and a panel arriving next to the object. That distinction is the whole reason this
 * replaced a row in the console rather than being moved into one somewhere else.
 *
 * **A child of the layer, not a portal.** Every other floating thing on this page is
 * `Popover`, and this deliberately is not one. A portal to `<body>` is positioned in
 * viewport pixels, so it drifts the moment the canvas scrolls — which is why Popover
 * closes on scroll, a behaviour that is right for a menu and absurd for the thing you
 * are typing into. Living inside `#region-layer` makes the card a percentage of the
 * same box the rectangles are a percentage of: it moves when they move, scrolls when
 * they scroll, and is clipped by the frame, which is the correct answer rather than a
 * limitation — the card belongs to the picture.
 *
 * **Selection is the open state.** There is no toggle and nothing to dismiss: the
 * selected box is the one being edited, and the one being edited is the one showing a
 * card. It goes transparent mid-drag, because a card over the rectangle you are
 * dragging is a card in the way of the thing it describes.
 *
 * Transparent rather than unmounted, and that distinction cost a real bug. Returning
 * null while `boxDrag` was set tore the card down and built it again around every
 * gesture, so its mount effects re-ran on release — which pulled focus into the prompt
 * field after *moving* a box, not just after drawing one. ⌫ then edited text instead of
 * deleting the rectangle, which is precisely the keyboard fault this redesign set out
 * to fix, reintroduced by the thing that fixed it. Found by `check_regions.py` on its
 * first run, which is the argument for the file.

            empty index the control was a dead white box indistinguishable from a
            live one, which is a click that does nothing and says nothing about
            why. Both halves are fixed below and in ui.css.

            `+ LoRA` rather than "No LoRA", for the same reason the strip's door
            says it: an empty control should name the act, not the absence. Word
            for word what `LoraButton` reads, so one label opens a LoRA picker
            wherever you are — and it is the *name* that is the value here, so the
