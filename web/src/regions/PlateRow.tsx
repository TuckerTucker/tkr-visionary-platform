/**
 * Every picture the image run can be given, at rest — the image side's SourceRow.
 *
 * The tiles lived only on the frame card, which is two undiscovered gestures
 * deep: a double-click nobody guesses to get a box, then a corner button to
 * reach the card. The owner filed the whole feature as "the regional feature
 * doesn't work" with the engine healthy underneath it, which is the strongest
 * form of the rule this row answers: a feature a user can't see is one that
 * doesn't exist. So the tiles moved here — moved, not copied, because two live
 * homes for one attachment is a second way to do the first thing.
 *
 * Visible whenever the composer is on images, boxes or none. The plates do
 * need a region, but a dead tile teaches nothing — the natural order is often
 * plate first ("compose into this"), boxes second, and the store has no
 * problem holding a plate while the canvas is still empty. What carries the
 * gate is the note under the prompt, which names the gesture that is missing
 * rather than refusing the drop.
 *
 * Locked, not hidden, without the edit weight — the card's original argument,
 * verbatim: an install without the edit LoRA is one download away from scene
 * and outfit transfer and had no way of learning either existed.
 *
 * **The object plates are the cast row's grammar on the image side.** V12's
 * sockets 3 and 4 take a photograph plus the user's own sentence about what it
 * is, and the video side already solved exactly that shape — a thumbnail, an
 * inline note, a remove — in `scene/Material`. Same classes, same gesture, so
 * the two sides read as one application. The note is not decoration: an
 * object the prompt never refers to does close to nothing, which is why the
 * backend refuses a note-less plate and the placeholder writes the sentence's
 * shape out.
 *
 * **The tiles are taps, not drop targets** — the video side's `SourceRow` rule,
 * arrived on this side. The frame takes every plate by drag now, in the band
 * along its bottom edge (`canvas/drop/ImageDrops`), so a tile that also lit up
 * under a file would be two targets for one picture. They stay because on glass
 * there is nothing to drag from and the tap that opens the file picker is the
 * whole of attaching there — and because this is where you see what is attached
 * and clear it.
