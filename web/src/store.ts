/**
 * The app state, in one store.
 *
 * The vanilla page kept 27 module-level `let`s *and* used the DOM as the rest of
 * its state — `#g-aspect`'s value was the aspect, `#g-regional.on` was the mode,
 * `dataset.touched` was "you chose this". Both are rehomed here. That is the
 * only structural change the port makes, because every one of those values
 * exists for a reason recorded elsewhere.
 *
 * **What deliberately did not come across.** Values that change at pointer rate
 * or are handles on a DOM node stay out — `growing` (a reentrancy latch inside
 * `autoGrow`), `dragEnd`, `menuEl`, `promptCaret`. The rule the split follows:
 * **if a value changes at pointer rate, or is a handle on a DOM node, it is a
 * ref.**
 *
 * A region drag is the one place that rule had to be argued rather than applied.
 * The boxes *are* in the store, and a drag writes them, because the inspector's
 * four numbers are a readout that moves while you drag — that is the whole reason
 * they survived the row they used to live in, so dropping the writes until
 * `pointerup` would delete the feature to save the frames. What the drag does
 * instead is coalesce: one store write per animation frame, however many
 * `pointermove` events arrive inside it. See `regions/RegionLayer.tsx`.
 *
 * **An empty string means "the model decides", and that replaces
 * `data-touched`.** The vanilla page stamped an attribute on a field the moment
 * you typed in it, so that rebuilding the video composer for a new checkpoint
 * would not hand your sampler back to a default. Here a control holds `''` until
 * you set it, and `console/resolve.ts` reads the model's own default through it.
 * Same rule, flag deleted: a value you chose is yours and survives a model
 * change, a value that was only the previous model's default is not — and it
 * survives *only if the new model offers it*, which is what stopped
 * res_multistep quietly overriding a sampler the model's own templates use.

   * - `content` — one region's card, for the frequent act: its sentence and its
   *   photograph. No rectangles and no coordinates: what is drawn is the open box
   *   alone — its hairline, because a card with no scope is a card about nothing in

   *   clicked is not one of those; asking for a modifier to move the rectangle in
   *   front of you is friction with nothing behind it.
   * - `geometry` — the rare act: every box, its handles, the snapping, the four
   *   coordinates and the frame's own card. Reached by ⌘-click, or a long press
   *   where there is no modifier to hold. Clearing the canvas first was the earlier answer and it was
   *   invented friction: ⌘ already means "geometry" on the frame, where ⌘-drag is
   *   "a new box, here", so it means the same thing over a render.
