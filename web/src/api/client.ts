/**
 * The one seam between the page and the 33 routes.
 *
 * Ported from `api()`/`post()` in UI_HTML rather than replaced, because the
 * contract is load-bearing and unobvious: **a failed request comes back as
 * `{error}`, it never throws.** A 500 from Modal is a plain-text traceback, so
 * `r.json()` rejects inside whichever caller happened to make the request and
 * takes the rest of that function with it — `loadState()` died on
 * `s.models.filter` and left the composer looking like a deployment with no
 * weights on it. Every caller here is written expecting to test for `error`,
 * so a `fetch` wrapper that throws would break them all silently.
 *
 * The typing follows from that: `Res<T>` is `T | ApiError`, and `failed()` is
 * the narrowing guard. There is deliberately no `unwrap()` that throws — it
 * would reintroduce exactly the failure this shape exists to prevent.

 * this page was 400 characters of Modal traceback, in an `alert()` or an err-box, with
 * the one useful word somewhere in the middle of it. A person cannot act on that, and
 * the person who *can* act on it wants the whole thing rather than the first 400 bytes.
 * Splitting it serves both: the sentence says what to do, `detail` rides along for the

 * and everything on this page comes off that origin — the gallery's covers,
 * the stills on the canvas, and a `<video>` re-requesting byte ranges for as
 * long as it plays. A pile of polls starves them: the clip stutters and the
