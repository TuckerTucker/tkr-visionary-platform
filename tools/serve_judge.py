"""
Serve a model in a throwaway Sandbox and mark something with it.

    python3.11 tools/serve_judge.py --dump enrich.jsonl        # score prompts
    python3.11 tools/serve_judge.py --pairs out/ --briefs d.log --model <vlm>

A Sandbox rather than a deployed function, on purpose: nothing about the app
changes to run this, so a judge that turns out to be useless costs a few minutes
of GPU and leaves no trace.

**It was `stress_parse.py`, which existed to choose a model for `/api/parse` by
measurement rather than by argument.** That route is gone and the reason it is
gone is the thing this file should still be read for: eleven scored rows, every
one of them a string comparison, and not one of them asking whether the picture
got better. A model that returned the sentence unchanged scored perfectly, which
is exactly what the incumbent did — zero invented words across 27 fragments,
read as maximum restraint, with the feature reaching 0% of renders.

So what survives is the serving, and the two things worth serving:

  --dump    text. `judge_prompts.py` marks a rewrite against what the person
            said, on four criteria that are read rather than totalled.
  --pairs   pictures. `judge_renders.py` scores rendered pairs blind, both
            orders, a win counted only when both agree. **The only measurement
            here that is not a proxy**, and what `prompt_ab.py` drives.
            `--rubric scene` is the same for clips, read as contact sheets
            with a labelled cast sheet ahead of them — see `ab_scene.py`.

Every line of the vLLM recipe below was settled by running it, and each carries
the failure that put it there — the `devel` CUDA base, the unpinned vLLM, the
urllib health probe, the multimodal limits. None of it is taste.
