"""
Pull plain-Python pieces out of app.py without importing it.

Shared by `smoke_prompt.py` and `preview_ui.py`, which both need the real thing
rather than a copy of it: a compiler checked against a reimplementation checks
the reimplementation, and a UI preview built against a hand-written vocabulary
is a preview of a palette that does not exist.

Importing app.py is what this avoids, for the reason `preview_ui.py` already
records — it pulls in modal and builds image definitions at module scope, so it
wants credentials and a network to answer a question about a string. The AST is
already on disk, and a module assembled from a subset of its top-level
statements runs on a laptop with no torch, no modal and no credentials.

The subset is named, never pattern-matched. A rename upstream should fail here
loudly rather than quietly hand back one function fewer.
