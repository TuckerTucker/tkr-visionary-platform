What Krea 2 pays for leaving SageAttention, and what it stops paying in pictures.

    modal run tools/ab_sage.py
    modal run tools/ab_sage.py --prompt "..." --seed 1234

`_krea2_graph` puts a `ModelAttentionBackend` node first on the model chain, so
every Krea 2 render is on PyTorch attention while `--use-sage-attention` stays
argv for H3. That was decided on a mechanism and a pile of upstream reports —
the sm90 kernel quantizes V to FP8 with one scale per channel and runs with
both of its outlier mitigations off — and a mechanism is not a measurement.
This is the measurement: same seed, same prompt, one warm container, the graph
as built and the graph with the node cut out.

The timing is the point that needed a number. The blotches are the point that
needs eyes, and they are intermittent, so a clean pair here proves nothing on
its own — pass the prompt and seed of a render that actually blotched and look
at the two files.
