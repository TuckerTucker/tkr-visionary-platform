Smoke test for every graph this app builds — all variants, on CPU, no weights.

    modal run tools/smoke_graphs.py

Checks that every graph `_krea2_graph` and `_h3_graph` can emit is
structurally valid against the ComfyUI build pinned in `comfy_image`: every
`class_type` exists, every input key is a real input on that node, and every
link points at a node in the same graph.

This was `smoke_video.py`, and covered video only because images ran on a
vendored Forge with a smoke test of its own that imported the backend. There is
one backend now, so there is one of these. The Krea 2 variants also make it the
check for the custom node pack: `/object_info` lists a node only if it
imported, so a pack that raises on import fails here on a CPU container rather
than at the first regional render on a warm H100.

Why this is worth its own tool. The graphs are written as Python dicts against
Comfy's templates, so the failure they invite is a name: a node renamed
upstream, an input that moved, a slot that shifted. ComfyUI answers that with a
validation error *after* the container is up — which for video means an H100
cold start behind up to 28.6 GB of weights. The names can be checked against
`/object_info` in about a minute on a CPU container instead, and `/object_info`
does not care whether a single weight is on the volume.

So this runs ComfyUI with `--cpu` and never loads a model. Which also sets the
boundary of what it proves:

- It DOES catch a wrong node name, a wrong or misspelled input, a dangling
  link, and a required input the builder forgot.
- It DOES catch a wrong value in a fixed combo — `CLIPLoader.type` having to be
  "minimax" or "krea2", a sampler or scheduler this deployment offers that
  ComfyUI does not have, `ref_image_size`. Those lists are compiled in, so they
  are populated with no weights present.
- It DOES catch a model-sampling node whose baked-in multiplier disagrees with
  the checkpoint's own config. That one is checked against
  `comfy.supported_models` rather than against a name, because it is the shape
  of failure names cannot reach: `ModelSamplingSD3` and `ModelSamplingAuraFlow`
  differ only in a number neither node exposes, both validate, and sending
  Krea 2 the wrong one returns coloured noise at the right step count with no
  error anywhere. See `_check_model_sampling`.
- It does NOT catch a filename that is not on the volume. Loader nodes take a
  combo too, but one whose options are the files ComfyUI can see, and with no
  weights present every one of those lists is empty. Emptiness is what
  separates the two cases, and it is what this skips on: `_require_models()`
  covers the file combos, and it covers them before the GPU is rented.
- It does not run a sampler, so it says nothing about whether a clip looks
  right. Sampling flags are structurally valid whatever they are set to;
  getting one wrong produces a washed-out clip, not an error, and only a real
  run will show it.

A pass here means the graphs are wired to nodes that exist. It does not mean
the video is good.

**One half runs on a laptop:** `python3 tools/smoke_graphs.py` checks the
out-point arithmetic — where a saved motion latent is cut so a trimmed take
continues from its cut (`_h3_cut_index`) — and then says how to run the rest.
That half needs no ComfyUI because what it guards is not a node name but the
pack's slicing rule, which is arithmetic: a cut that does not end on the VAE's
17-frame cycle is a latent the pack refuses, or reads at the wrong instant.
