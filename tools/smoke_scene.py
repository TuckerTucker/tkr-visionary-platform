    python3 tools/smoke_scene.py

`smoke_prompt.py` covers the flat typed+pills document. This covers the one the
composer sends, and it is a different question: that one asks whether a sentence
and some pills come out as the published *format*, and this one asks whether a
cast and a timeline come out as the published *grammar* — shot markers, cut
times, speaker IDs, retention markers, task types, the transition tokens.

Every assertion below is a line in MiniMax's `h3-prompt-writing` skill — the
clone lives at `~/MiniMax-H3`, outside this repo, because it is 255MB read by
hand rather than by anything here — and
the ones worth naming are the ones where a wrong answer is still a *valid*
document that quietly says something else:

- **`<Picture N>` is the upload index, not the cast order.** Number by cast
  order and every label is well-formed and points at somebody else's face.
- **A speaker ID belongs to a vocal event, not to a character.** The guide is
  explicit that characters who never vocalise receive none, so a scene bucket or
  a prop carrying an `(S)` is a speaker H3 will look for and never find.
- **`(Sx)` never appears in `retention_analysis`.** Easy to leak in from the
  body, and the guide forbids it outright.
- **`<scenetrans>` goes at *both* connecting points.** One marker at the cut
  does not say the audio continues *into* the next shot.
- **Cut times strictly increase and land inside the clip.** They come off the
  strip precisely so two rows cannot be out of order.
- **`overall_soundscape` is never `N/A` by default.** `N/A` there means
  complete silence, *requested* — see the note on `H3_SOUNDSCAPE_DEFAULT`.
- **No scene means no change.** The flat path has to still be the flat path.

# scene and nothing else. No filler, no enhancement, nothing invented — so
# every sentence in the output has to trace back to something a person placed:
# a chip, a row, a slot, a pill, a toggle.
#

# needs to open it and edit, the scene creator is missing a control, and the
# thing they had to type is the name of the control it is missing.

# choice the person made. Anything else is a gap, and the three below are the
# gaps as they stand — each is a control the composer does not have yet, so

# sentence about nothing — is gone, and it went the way this list wants them
# all to go: not by inventing a better default, but by making the state
