Does a step cache pay for itself on a real take? Act one was CacheDiT; act
two is TeaCache, at the production shape act one taught us to insist on.

    modal run tools/ab_cache.py::smoke     # CPU: do the packs even import
    modal run tools/ab_cache.py::main      # H100: stock vs teacache, timed

Three arms, one warm container. **`_h3_graph` is no longer a stock graph** —
it splices `VisionaryStepCache` itself at anything over H3_CACHE_MIN_STEPS, so
the arm that used to be called stock had the shipped cache in it and the
teacache arm had two caches stacked, each measuring its skips against the
other's reused output. `_without_cache` takes the node back out, which is what
makes `stock` mean stock; `shipped` is what `_h3_graph` actually builds, and
is the arm to move when the node changes; `teacache` is the third-party pack
the mechanism was first proven with, kept so its number stays reproducible.
Same seed on every timed run, 20 steps — the full-quality path, which is the
only population step-skipping serves; distilled runs have nothing to skip.

The verdict is two numbers and two files: wall-clock per arm, and the takes
themselves for eyes and ears — the audio stream rides the same cached blocks,
so listen, don't just look.

The pack is cloned at container start, pinned by SHA — the ab_style pattern:
the deployed app does not grow a node pack for an experiment. cache-dit is
pinned to the release measured here; it imports lazily inside the node, so a
broken dependency surfaces at the node call, and the CPU smoke exists to find
that for cents before an H100 finds it for dollars.

TeaCache's physics dodge what sank CacheDiT: its skip test is one rel-L1
over the *latent* — a few million elements, not 768p hidden states — and it
wraps apply_model rather than patching blocks in place, so computed steps
cost stock price and nothing persists on the resident model. The trade sits
on the other side: a skip reuses the whole previous output, cruder per skip
than DBCache's partial recompute. Known pack defects, priced in: no H3
calibration despite the README (raw rel-L1, "polynomial is Phase-2"), and
node-output caching makes a second identical execution reuse spent state —
harmless here, one execution per arm; a 3-line fix if it ever ships.

POSTSCRIPT (act one) — the 1.40x this file measured was real and did not survive
production shape: at 768p on 8-10s takes the wrapper inflated computed
steps ~50% (TaylorSeer calibrator on by default, boundary clones, residual
bookkeeping — all scaling with tensor size while skips did not), and the
pack was removed. docs/decisions.md § "CacheDiT lasted one day" is the full
account. If you are re-running this harness, run it at production shape.
