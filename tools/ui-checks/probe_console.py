"""
How tall the console gets, and whether that still fits the 30% budget.

Replaces the earlier `measure_console.py`, which had gone stale in a way worth
recording: it drove `#kinds`, `#toggle-adv` and `#v-toggle-adv`, none of which
survived the console redesign — Advanced became the model/sampling popovers and
the kind switch became a chip in the prompt field. It still ran, still printed a
table, and the numbers were of a page it was no longer opening. A harness that
reports on controls it failed to click is worse than no harness, so this one
asserts the selector exists before it measures anything.

The budget is 30% of the viewport. `fieldMax()` hands the prompt whatever is
left after everything else, so the worst case is not a long prompt on its own —
it is a long prompt with the pill rail wrapped and regions armed,
because those arrive long after the last keystroke. That is the state the
ResizeObserver exists for, and the one that measured 38.1% without it.

**The assertion is the formula, not the 30%**, and the difference is the whole
reason this file is worth having. A bare `frac <= 0.30` fails at 1440x900 —
the budget leaves the field about 38px there, `FIELD_FLOOR` clamps it to 52,
and the console lands at 31.6%. That is not a regression, it is the documented
trade: below two lines the box stops being a place you can write, so the floor
is allowed to win. Checking the symptom would have reported the design as a bug
on the shortest viewport anyone uses. So what is pinned is

    field  == max(FLOOR, min(CEIL, innerHeight * 0.30 - other))

which is true at every viewport, says *why* the console is over when it is over,
and is exactly what a React `fieldMax` has to reproduce.
