Which drop targets actually accept a file? Real DataTransfer, real events.

    python3 tools/ui-checks/check_drop.py                        # vanilla
    python3 tools/ui-checks/check_drop.py http://localhost:5173  # React

Takes a URL, like check_viewer.py, because this is the shape every port check
should take — and because every target it names was re-implemented in the React
port, so a check that can only run against one of the two front ends is a check
that cannot say whether the port kept the behaviour.

Making it URL-parameterised meant giving up the vanilla page's globals. It used
to reset state with `refs.length = 0; drawRefs()` and switch sides with
`setKind('video')`, neither of which exists in a bundled front end — so the
driving is gestures now: click the kind chip, click a filled tile to clear it.
That is a better check on either front end for the reason the drag test already
records: a driver poking at internals is not a user, and the handler it is
poking past may be the broken one.
