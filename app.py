"""
Visionary — standalone Krea 2 LoRA trainer on Modal.

One file. One command. No Vercel, no npm, no Modal Secrets, no access keys.
The UI is served by Modal itself, so `modal deploy app.py` gives you a single
URL that is the whole application.

    modal deploy app.py

Training runs on musubi-tuner. Inference — images and video both — runs on
ComfyUI, driven over its API rather than ported, and pinned by commit. They are
deliberately separate images: ComfyUI wants newer transformers than musubi
pins, and coupling them would mean every ComfyUI bump re-litigates training.

Storage is ours, not borrowed. The volume is created on first deploy and the
layout is flat and self-describing — nothing here mirrors a checkout of another
project, so there is no directory that only makes sense to somebody who has
read a backend's source.

its own storage.

# Weights live on their own v2 volume, and the number that put them there is
# 0.08 GB/s: that is what tools/cold_start.py measured the v1 volume serving,
# single-stream or 8-way alike, which priced a cold H3 start at 240 seconds of
# its 300 reading the checkpoint. The same probe read this volume at 1.61.
#
# **1.61 is the steady-state number, not the first one.** A file freshly seeded
# onto this volume reads once at roughly a tenth of that, then is fast forever
# after. On 2026-08-25 the migration re-downloaded every weight, and Krea 2's
# one slow read landed four hours later on a real render: 8.5 GB of text
# encoder at 87 MB/s, then 24 GB of DiT at 81 MB/s — the second charged to step
# 0 of 8, where comfy-aimdo shows it only as "Model Initializing" and the tqdm
# bar sits at 0% for five minutes. Measured against the 1.61 above it read as a
# regression, and three theories died before the next cold start came back
# normal. H3 looked immune purely because tools/cold_start.py had already read
# its weights that morning. **Read every weight once after seeding a volume**,
# or the first person to render pays for it and gets no hint why.
#
# v2 is Beta, and Modal's own docs decline to promise no data loss — which is
# exactly why *only* weights are here. A weight is a receipt: every file on
# this volume re-downloads from the gear. Datasets, LoRAs and characters are
# records, and records do not move to storage with a disclaimer. If v2 ever
# eats this volume, the cost is re-downloading checkpoints, not somebody's

DATASETS = WORKSPACE / "datasets"

# Both inference paths are Hopper now, for one reason each. Video: SageAttention

# loads the weights, finds no kernel, and silently runs on the slow path.
# Images: memory. Krea 2 used to have an A100-40GB of its own, sized against a
# measured 29.26 GiB peak at 1024px — that headroom does not survive V12, whose
# own regression notes record a 30.27 GiB block-mask build and a 17.88 GiB dense
# score tensor at the sequence lengths reference frames produce. Sage stopped
# being the image side's reason when `_krea2_graph` opted out of it; the
# rebuild-forcing arch pin below is still shared, because the image is.
GPU = os.environ.get("VISIONARY_IMAGE_GPU", "H100")

# Video is still its own GPU class, and still for the original reason: the H3
# stack is 42.5 GB of weights before any activations, so it does not share a
# card with training or Krea 2. Sharing the *image* is new; sharing the
# container is not on the table while both hold a checkpoint resident.
VIDEO_GPU = os.environ.get("VISIONARY_VIDEO_GPU", "H100")

# Cards the UI may ask for, per feature.
#
# Modal's Cls.with_options() returns a variant that autoscales independently of
# the base configuration — which is exactly the point (one class, any card) and
# exactly the cost (a card you have not used recently has no warm container, so
# picking it pays a cold start). The UI confirms before switching for that
# reason, and requests for the default are sent to the base class rather than
# through with_options so the common path keeps its warm container.
#
# Both lists are Hopper-only on purpose: SageAttention is compiled for sm_90 in
# comfy_image. B200 is sm_100 and would load the model fine and then fall back
# off the fast kernels — the failure this list exists to prevent. Adding it
# means changing TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST and forcing an image rebuild. The A100
# entries that used to be here went with the same rebuild: sm_80 is not sm_90.
IMAGE_GPUS = ("H100", "H200")

# ComfyUI is the inference backend for both images and video, pinned by commit
# rather than vendored.
#
# It was the video backend first, and Krea 2 ran on a vendored Forge next door.
# What ended that split was regional prompting: it was the one feature Forge
# could do and ComfyUI could not, because Forge Couple's cross-attention design
# cannot reach a single-stream DiT and reaching it needed a patch to
# backend/nn/krea.py. CLIFF_SHA below is a node pack that does the same job
# through ComfyUI's own hooks and does it better — it masks each LoRA's
# activation delta to its box, so there is no pathway left for one character's
# identity to reach another's, where masking attention only makes it unlikely.
# With the one blocker gone, keeping a second backend, a second image and a
# second GPU class bought nothing.
#
# Why ComfyUI at all, when diffusers has a MiniMax-H3 pipeline: the diffusers
# integration runs the released bf16 weights, 123.6 GB across the transformer
# and the Qwen3-VL-32B conditioner. ComfyUI runs Comfy's repackage — modulation
# weights pruned into a lookup table, int8-convrot weights, and their own
# kernels — for 42.5 GB and int8 tensor-core matmuls instead of bf16 ones. On
# one card that is the difference between offloading every request and holding
# the model resident, on top of roughly 2x on the denoise loop itself.
# Pinned — and not for reproducibility, which is the reason that usually gets
# given and the one that matters least here. GenAI work is iterative; nobody
# needs this month's render back pixel-for-pixel in three.
#
# It is pinned because **a pin is the only thing that pulls upstream in.**
# Unpinning sounds like tracking latest and is the opposite: Modal's layer cache
# key is the command string, not the world, so `git clone --depth 1 <branch>` is
# a constant and that layer caches until something *above* it changes. Unpinned,
# the build sits on whatever HEAD was current the last time torch moved, with
# nothing recording which. Bumping a SHA is deliberate, guaranteed, and says
# what you got.
#
# Neither arrangement rebuilds when upstream churns — the cache key is the same
# either way — so the pin costs nothing for the hundred commits a week that
# never reach a render. What it lacks is a reason to look, and that is
# `tools/upstream.py`: it buckets what changed by the paths this app's behaviour
# rides on, so 168 files touched reads as "17 of them matter" rather than as a
# number to feel behind about.
#
# What upstream guarantees on its own, and what it does not: node ids, input
# ids, output slot indices and new required inputs are all migrated server-side
# on `POST /prompt` by `NodeReplace` — they maintain one for a node id with a
# *trailing space*. What has no migration is the arithmetic. In the range this
# bump crossed, `comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py` moved +150/-64 with every name
# intact.

# tokenized audio conditioning produced. The eleven commits upstream of

# the graph builder below can stop matching the node it builds for.
#
# Its whole surface on ComfyUI is public: it wraps the diffusion model through
# comfy.patcher_extension, swaps attention through the transformer_options
# `optimized_attention_override` hook, and loads LoRAs with
# comfy.sd.load_lora_for_models. All of it exists at COMFY_SHA, which is what
# makes this an install rather than a vendor — nothing here is patched, so
# forge/VENDOR.md has no successor.
#
# Re-checked across the 2026-08-03 -> 2026-08-22 bump, because a pinned pack
# against a moved host is the one place this arrangement could rot quietly: all
# **12** symbols it names survive, and `patcher_extension.py` is byte-identical.
# The one thing that did move is instructive rather than alarming —
# `optimized_attention_override` grew an optional `container_function` branch
# and kept `override(func, *args, **kwargs)` as the fallback, so a pack passing
# a plain callable takes the same path it always did. That is the shape of
# nearly every ComfyUI change in the range: additive, because breaking a node
# id or a hook breaks thousands of installs at once.
#
# One node out of the pack's six is wired up: V12. It subclasses V9, so V9's
# engine ships whether or not it is reachable, and exposing both would mean two
# sets of semantics on the page for one capability.

    # This was deliberately left unset for a long time, on the grounds that
    # hf_transfer has no progress hook and a weaker resume story — the two
    # properties that once turned a stalled download into a four-hour silence.
    # Both halves of that were measured on this image against a 21 GB file
    # rather than reasoned about, and they did not survive it:
    #
    #   plain requests    30.6 MB/s     hf_transfer   243.8 MB/s
    #
    # 8x, and it is the whole gap between "over 200 MB/s with the hf CLI" and a
    # platform that took a working day to fetch its own weights. The progress
    # objection was already dead: `_staged_bytes` sums the tree, which is
    # indifferent to which backend wrote it, and is exactly how those numbers
    # were taken. The resume objection is real and confirmed — killed mid-file,
    # plain requests restarts at 0.29 of 0.29 GB and hf_transfer at 0.00 of
    # 5.09 — but it is now an objection to something that costs less than it
    # saves: at this speed the largest weight in the catalogue lands in under
    # two minutes, which is shorter than DOWNLOAD_STALL_S itself. Resume was
    # machinery for a fifteen-minute download, and there is no longer one.
    #
    # Falling back to the plain backend on a retry was measured too and does
    # work — it picks up hf_transfer's bytes rather than starting over — but it
    # is deliberately not done: it buys a resume for a two-minute transfer at
    # the price of an 8x slower one, and a second backend on the failure path
    # is a second set of behaviour that only ever runs when things are already
    # going wrong. Retries stay on hf_transfer and start over.

# the same attention kernels, and one node pack that only the image side loads.
#
# The CUDA version is the whole point of this image, not an incidental pin.

# CUDA backend below 13, falling back to plain torch ops — which silently
# throws away exactly the int8-convrot and nvfp4 kernels the H3 repackage is
# quantized for. A cu128 build would load the same weights, produce the same
# pictures, and run at roughly half the speed with no error to explain it.

# check `Comfy-Kitchen ... {'cuda': True}` is still in the container's logs.

    # ── MiniMax-H3 speed LoRAs ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # MiniMax's own Lightning distillations, in the repo the H3 weights already
    # come from — 20 steps down to 8 or 4. They are the answer to the line this
    # file used to carry, that H3 had "no ecosystem for the int8 repackage":
    # there is one, it is first-party, and it was two directories from the
    # transformer we were already downloading.
    #
    # They load through `LoraLoaderModelOnly` like anything else, and the
    # `turbo_mode` toggle ComfyUI's tutorial describes is that node with a
    # switch in front of it. Worth writing down, because grepping
    # `comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py` for "turbo" returns nothing at either
    # COMFY_SHA or master and reads as proof the feature does not exist. It
    # does: the t2v and i2v templates wrap it in a *subgraph* and promote
    # `turbo_mode`, `turbo_model_strength` and `turbo_steps` as widgets, and
    # `video_minimax_h3_r2v.json` — which is not a subgraph — shows the parts
    # unwrapped: a `PrimitiveBoolean`, two `ComfySwitchNode`s choosing between
    # the bare DiT and `LoraLoaderModelOnly(DiT)` and between two step counts.
    #
    # So there is nothing to add here. That switch exists because a template is
    # a fixed graph and needs a way to turn a node off; this console has a LoRA
    # picker and a steps control, so the toggle is two controls it already has.
    #
    # One provenance note the templates carry and the repo does not: the 8-step
    # file is `lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo` upstream and is *mirrored* into
    # Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3. Pulled from the mirror so the whole family is one
    # repo id and one token.
    #
    # Paired to a transformer rather than to an expert: fl2v is the t2v/i2v
    # DiT, ref2v is the reference one. Crossing them is not something this
    # picker can prevent — see the note on `vidExpert` — so the labels say
    # which is which.

# Krea's own style LoRAs — nine repos, one 0.47 GB file each, ungated.
#
# Built by loop rather than written out nine times because they differ in two
# fields and agree on the other six; the alternative is ninety lines where the
# only thing worth reading is a name and a trigger. This is the one place in
# the catalogue where that is true — every other entry differs in repo, path,
# size and family at once, and a loop over those would hide more than it saved.
#
# Each lands as a *loose file at the top of loras/*, not in a shared folder.
# That is the storage contract doing real work: a folder is one LoRA and the
# files in it are that LoRA's epochs, so `loras/krea-styles/` holding nine
# unrelated styles would collapse to a single picker row offering nine
# "epochs" of a LoRA that does not exist. Loose, each is its own row and its
# own `<lora:darkbrush:1>`.
#
# They are here because regional multi-character LoRA is the hardest thing
# this app does to *show*. Two character LoRAs in two boxes produce a picture
# of two people, and nothing in that picture distinguishes "each LoRA was
# masked to its rectangle" from "the model drew two people". Two styles do:
# ink wash on the left, motion blur on the right and a hard seam between them
# is the activation delta being zeroed outside the box, which is the actual
# claim. A first-party, ungated set that anyone can download is what makes
# that demonstrable on someone else's install rather than only on this one.
# What the picker writes for one of these when nothing else says otherwise.
# Measured on first-run renders rather than argued: retroanime at the generic
# 1.0 with no phrase in the prompt reads as a grade over the picture, not a
# style — the weight is live and looks like it did nothing, which is the
# failure the LoRA note exists to catch. At 1.3 with the phrase present the
# style is unmistakably on. Served per entry so the page never hardcodes it.

# Qwen3-VL, not a booru tagger and not JoyCaption.
#
# Krea 2 reads its prompt through Qwen3-VL-4B, a language model that parses
# grammar — subordinate clauses, spatial prepositions, and the binding between
# an adjective and the noun it modifies. Tag lists cannot express binding at
# all: "red, blue, dress, jacket" leaves the model to guess which colour
# belongs to which garment, and with two people in frame that guess is where
# attribute bleed comes from. A sentence resolves it by construction.
#
# The second reason is symmetry. You prompt in prose, so the captions should be
# prose — any gap between how the dataset describes an image and how you
# describe the one you want is a gap the model has to guess across. Captioning
# with the same model family the text encoder comes from closes that gap
# further than a differently-trained captioner can.
#
# Which *checkpoint* of it is a choice, because a refusal is not an error here.
# The stock instruct model declines on photographs of real people often enough
# to matter — "I can't identify or describe individuals in images" — and on a
# character set that is every image. What arrives is not an exception: it is a
# fluent, well-formed sentence that goes straight into a `.txt` sidecar and then
# into a training run, so the failure surfaces as a LoRA that learned to say it
# cannot describe someone. The abliterated repackage has the refusal direction
# removed and is otherwise the same architecture and the same loader, so it
# costs a repo id rather than a second code path. `_looks_like_refusal()` is the

    Bring the volume forward. Returns False if it had to be skipped.

    Modal refuses a reload while anything on the volume is still open, and a
    container that has loaded a checkpoint always has something open: safetensors
    maps the weights straight off /workspace and the mapping outlives the file
    descriptor, so the kernel is still holding /workspace long after the loader
    returned. The first `generate` in a fresh container reloaded fine because
    nothing was loaded yet, and every request after it raised — one image per
    container, then `ConflictError: there are open files preventing the
    operation` for the rest of the container's life.

    Raising there is the wrong trade. A reload is a *freshness* step: it exists
    so a LoRA trained ten minutes ago is visible to a warm container. Skipping it
    costs a stale listing until that container scales down; raising cost every
    generation after the first. Everything the job is about to open was already
    validated by the web container, which holds nothing open and reloads on
    every request, so the reload here is the second look, not the only one.

    Only the open-files conflict is absorbed. Any other reload failure is still
    an error, because it says something about the volume rather than about what
    this container happens to be holding.

    Serialised, because two of these at once is not two reloads — it is one
    reload and one 500. `/api/file` has always noted that concurrent reloads of
    the same volume returned an error for one of two simultaneous requests, and
    the canvas now asks for a batch of stills at once, all of which miss on the
    first look at a brand-new job. The lock turns that from a race into a queue.

    And a queue of twelve identical reloads is the wrong end of that trade,
    which is the half this used to be missing. A gallery is a grid and a canvas
    is a batch, so the misses arrive together and every one of them wanted the
    same thing: a view newer than the moment it asked. One reload gives that to
    all of them. Twelve gives it to all of them too, eleven of them twice over,
    while the browser's connection budget sits inside this function and the
    `<video>` waiting on a range request behind it stutters.

    So the sequence number is read *before* queueing: anyone who finds it moved
    by the time they hold the lock has been overtaken by a reload that began
    after they asked, which is the freshness they came for. Anyone who started

    descriptor of ours left on /workspace to refuse anyone's reload. What
    remains here are the paths that mutate the mount and are asked about

# Sessions — a training run, as a thing that outlives the run
#
# A session is the setup: which set, which name, which dials, and a pointer at
# the last job spawned from it. Runs are concurrent because `train_job` shares
# nothing between them, so what the page needs is not a "current run" but a
# board — and a board needs records that survive the window that made them.
#
# Everything here reads and writes exactly one Dict key. See `sessions` at the
# top of the file for why that is not a shortcut.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------


# How long a record may go without a beat before its claim to be running is not
# believed. Deliberately generous: `_run` beats on every tqdm line, but the
# gaps between them are the phases that print nothing — a cold container pulling
# the trainer image, the latent cache committing a large set — and calling one
# of those dead would show a failed card for a run that is fine. Twenty minutes
# of silence is a container that is gone.

#
# Backed by ComfyUI, the same backend video runs on. musubi's
# krea2_generate_image.py is a one-shot CLI: it reloaded ~35 GB of weights for
# every image and took a single LoRA at a single strength. This is a Modal Cls,
# so the checkpoint stays resident between requests, and LoRAs stack — any
# number of them, each with its own UNet and text-encoder weight.
#
# This ran on a vendored sd-webui-forge-classic until regional prompting stopped
# being a reason to keep it; see the note at CLIFF_SHA.

# else as "Value not in list", so "DPM++ 2M" is not a spelling of `dpmpp_2m`
# here, it is a rejected request. The old list was Forge's and every entry in it
# was wrong the moment the backend changed.
#
# A subset, not the full 40-odd, chosen the same way VIDEO_MODELS chooses:
# ancestral variants reintroduce noise each step, which fights an 8-step
# distilled Turbo, and the cfg_pp family is for models that take CFG. The full
# list is `python -c "import comfy.samplers; print(...)"` inside the container
# if one is ever wanted back.
#
# `er_sde` is the exception to the no-SDE rule and the reason the rule is worded
# about ancestral samplers rather than stochastic ones: it is an ER-SDE solver,
# so the noise it adds is scheduled by the solver rather than injected on top of
# the step, and it holds together at Turbo's step count where `euler_a` does not.

        `_revive()` covers a ComfyUI that died. This is the other half of the
        same idea: one that is alive and has nothing left to allocate, which is
        a state the process does not leave on its own.

        ComfyUI answers its own OOM with `unload_all_models()`, and on this
        install that is not enough. The regional node moves every region's LoRA
        onto the device in `_prepare()` and stores the copies on the patcher it
        returns, so they are held by the *execution cache* — which model
        management cannot see and `unload_all_models()` does not touch. They
        come back when the cached node output is dropped, and `/free` is the
        only thing that drops it (`e.reset()` in ComfyUI's prompt worker).

        Which is the shape the failure actually had: not one configuration too
        big, but a few in a row, none reproducible on its own. A run that ran
        out of memory left behind the thing it ran out of memory on, and the
        next one started with less room than the last.

        **That accumulation is now prevented rather than only recovered from.**
        `VisionaryFreeRegional` sits between the sampler and the decode on every
        regional graph and drops the session's device copies as the render ends
        — 1026 tensors a run, measured, with headroom flat at 46.7 GiB across
        three consecutive renders where it used to step down each time. This
        stays because prevention is not proof: a leak from somewhere else, or a
        single graph genuinely too big for the card, still lands here, and the
        node cannot help a run that has already failed.

        The bill is a checkpoint reload on the following take, charged only to a
        job that has already failed — against `max_containers=1`, where the
        alternative is every render refused until the scaledown window expires.

# Duplicates
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A set arrives with duplicates in it far more often than not: the same shoot
# exported twice, a JPEG saved beside the PNG it came from, a crop kept next to
# its original, a phone album pulled in through two different apps. They are
# not neutral. The trainer repeats every image the same number of times, so a
# picture that is present three times is trained three times as hard as the
# rest of the set — and the symptom of that ("everything comes out in that
# room") never points back at the folder it came from.
#
# Byte equality is the cheap half of the problem and the useless one. A
# duplicate that survived a re-encode, a resize or a colour-profile conversion
# has different bytes and is the same picture, which is exactly the case a
# `sha256` map reports as clean. So the grouping is perceptual — dHash, below —
# and the sha rides along beside it anyway, because "these are the same file"
# and "these are the same picture" are different facts and only the first one
# makes the choice for you.
#
# Nothing here decides anything. It groups, it ranks, and every ranking says
# which number decided it, because the keep/cut call is the one thing on this
# page that cannot be derived: "which of these two nearly identical frames is
# the better photograph" is not a measurement.

# Two classes, and the second one is not a softer first.
#
# A **duplicate** is one picture stored more than once — a re-encode, a resize,
# a reformat, a re-grade. Deleting all but one loses nothing, so a duplicate
# group arrives with a keeper already chosen.
#
# A **similar** pair is two photographs that look alike. On a training set that
# is usually a burst: four consecutive frames of one subject, all of them
# legitimately useful, and there is no deterministic way to prove the second is
# a re-save rather than the next shutter release. So a similar group is shown
# and nothing in it is preselected. Collapsing these two into one scale of
# confidence is the mistake this replaces — five tiers between them meant the
# common case (an export at the same size and format as its original) landed in
# the middle, where nothing is preselected and the keeper flow never runs.
#
# **Both hashes must agree, and the two are not doing the same job.** dHash
# reads edge gradients, pHash reads low-frequency DCT energy, and they fail
# independently — so an AND is far tighter than either alone and much tighter
# than accepting on whichever happens to be closer.
#
# Measured on a 731-image editorial set, 266,815 pairs. dHash is the
# discriminator: `dhash <= 6` on its own isolates exactly the three real
# duplicates in that folder, and the next-closest pair anywhere is 7 — but that
# pair is `d7 p32`, two entirely unrelated photographs, which is precisely what
# the pHash half is there to refuse. So the AND stays and the pHash bound is
# set by the *other* thing it has to survive.
#
# That thing is a re-grade. dHash barely moves under one — a quarter-stop
# brighter measures 3 bits, 1.4x measures 4 — while pHash climbs to 16, because
# a global exposure change with any clipping in it moves the coarse structure
# the DCT reads. A bound of 10 filed those as merely similar, which is wrong:
# the same picture, exported brighter, is a copy. Swept from 10 to 24 against
# the real folder the duplicate count never moves off 3, so the loosening is
# free there and is what makes the re-grade land.
#
# The gap between the two classes is therefore carried by dHash — 6 against 12
# — and that is the split the real data draws. Every burst-shaped pair in that
# folder (two frames of one runway look) measures dHash 8 to 11: outside
# `duplicate`, inside `similar`, which is exactly where a photograph that is
# merely alike belongs.

# Crop detection, and the leash that is the whole reason it is safe.
#
# A reframed copy moves every edge, so its direct distance sits outside both
# thresholds while a centre crop of one lines up exactly with the other. Two
# crops per image, compared every way but original-to-original — that comparison
# is the direct one, already made.
#
# **The variants are not the hazard; the threshold they were read at was.**
# Taking the best of nine variant pairs is nine chances to draw a low number
# against an unrelated image, so at a loose threshold it is ruinous: measured on
# a 731-image editorial set, accepting variant matches at dhash<=20/phash<=24
# flags 813 pairs against the 9 the direct comparison finds. Read at
# DUPLICATE_MATCH instead, the same nine pairs add **zero** pairs to that set,
# and land an 80% centre crop of a real photograph at distance 0 on both hashes.
# Strictly stronger evidence, and it may only ever claim **similar** — never a
# duplicate, so a crop match cannot preselect anything for deletion. That is
# also right on its own terms: a deliberate crop of a training image is a
# variation somebody made on purpose.
#
# What it does not reach is a crop it has no variant for. Measured on the same
# photograph: 90% and 80% land, 70% and 60% are missed. Catching those needs
# scale-invariant keypoints rather than a fixed grid of centre crops, which is a
# different technique and a much heavier one. The shares below are the cheap
# half of the problem and they are honest about being that.

# DUPLICATE_MATCH today. They were the same constant for an afternoon, and
# loosening the duplicate rule's pHash bound from 10 to 16 — a change argued
# entirely about *re-grades* — silently changed which crops the pass finds. That
# is a coupling with no reason behind it: a crop of a file has not been
# re-exposed, so the pHash headroom a re-grade needs is headroom a crop match
# gets for free, and it gets it nine times over because this is a minimum across

# The similar class is measured by a learned embedding, and the hashes above
# decide only the duplicate class. The two-class design survives; what moved is
# which instrument reads the second class, and the lesson is worth its length:
# **the editorial set the thresholds came from contained only exact copies**,
# so SIMILAR_MATCH was drawn from data with no true near-duplicate in it — a
# line calibrated on the wrong question. Measured against ground truth that
# actually holds near-duplicates (INRIA Holidays, 500 groups of one scene
# photographed from shifted viewpoints, 1,110,795 pairs), the hash band's best
# case is 5% recall at 17 false pairs, and no threshold rescues it: at
# d24/p26 recall is still 18% while false accepts pass 22,000. Gradient and
# DCT hashes measure *storage* similarity, so they find copies and cannot find
# the next shutter release — 199 of Holidays' same-scene pairs sit at cosine
# 0.95+ with hash distances up to d40/p36, invisible to any band.
#
# 0.94, and both folders drew the line. Below it the embedding stops
# separating "the same scene re-shot" from "the same shoot, different
# content": on the 731-image editorial folder the band from 0.90 to 0.925
# holds a pair of *different models* on one backdrop (0.923) and one model in
# two *different looks* on one stage (0.925) — pairs the page must never call
# alike, because a claim like that is how the classifier stops being believed
# — and then nothing at all until the exact copies at 1.0. On Holidays, 0.94
# still reads every burst-tier pair (the product's actual target) at a 7e-5
# false rate; what it gives up is the walk-around-the-corner viewpoint band at
# 0.86–0.93, where this instrument genuinely cannot tell a re-take from a
# different photograph of the same trip — both folders put true and false
# pairs at the same cosine there, so no line in that band is honest.

                                sampler, masking each region's LoRA to its box.
      * regions + a reference — V12's krea2edit path: the scene is regenerated
                                around the boxes and the identity-edit LoRA is
                                loaded.

    The middle one is the feature this backend was swapped for. It needs no
    reference image and no edit LoRA: V12 falls through to V9's likeness engine,
    which masks each LoRA's activation delta to its rectangle and samples once.

    # audio sequence is where the 2x lives. Krea 2 collects none of it, and

    # renders at 1024px/8 steps, 3.23s median on PyTorch against 3.26s on
    # sage. A 1024px render is ~4k tokens; attention is not the bill. So the
    # flag was buying this path nothing, and charging it the following.
    #
    # On sm90 sage dispatches to
    # `sageattn_qk_int8_pv_fp8_cuda_sm90`, which quantizes V to FP8 e4m3 with
    # one scale per channel across the whole sequence, and it runs there with
    # both of its outlier mitigations off: ComfyUI hardcodes `smooth_k=False`
    # at the call, the kernel hardcodes `smooth_v=False` inside. One outlier
    # token then sets the scale for every other token in its channel, and the
    # tokens that lose their resolution are a contiguous block of the image —
    # which is the shape of the intermittent black blotches this was reported
    # for. Krea 2 hands that kernel the worst tensors in the building:
    # `txtfusion` runs attention over the twelve RAW Qwen3-VL layers, the same
    # very large activations that already cost us `--bf16-text-enc`. Different
    # prompt, different outliers, which is why it was intermittent rather than
    # obvious — and why the three prompts ab_sage.py runs did not reproduce
    # it. **That attribution is unproven here.** What is proven is the price

# What a video model is allowed to ask for
#
# **There is one video family, and there was briefly two.** Wan 2.2 lived beside
# H3 here — same container, same warm process, same job/status/stop contract,
# a graph builder and a table row apart — which was the proof of the claim this
# backend rests on: driving ComfyUI rather than porting model code means a
# second family costs a graph and a table, not an image.
#
# It is gone because it was not worth its room. Everything it was *for* had
# been overtaken: CFG and a negative prompt are levers H3 does not need, the
# LoRA argument that once justified it was wrong in both directions (MiniMax
# ship their own Lightning distillations), and its own training path was tabled
# on a 64 GB duplicate-weights bill nobody was going to pay. What it left
# behind is silent video, half the catalogue, and a console asking every
# question twice.
#
# The dispatch it proved is still here — `requires` is per task, `supports` is
# per model, and the run is family-agnostic. A second family is a row and a
# graph builder, and that is the sentence this section exists to keep true.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------


# What the composer is allowed to ask for, per video model.
#
# Served to the page rather than written into it, for the reason the GPU list
# already is: which controls a model reads is a property of the model, and a
# copy in the HTML is a second source of truth that drifts the first time one
# of them changes. A control that is present but ignored is worse than one that
# is absent, so absent is what the model says it wants — which is why the keys
# here are the ones something actually reads. `cfg`, `negative` and `experts`
# were in this table and are not any more: with one guidance-distilled family
# they were three permanent `False`s, and a key whose only value is False is a
# branch the page keeps for a model that is not there.

# The shot palette
#
# H3 does not read a paragraph. It reads a document with named fields, and
# MiniMax publishes the format in the model repo — VIDEO_PROMPT_WRITING_GUIDE
# _base_en.md and _ref_en.md. The composer offered one textarea for it, which is
# the whole reason a first-time user has to guess where camera direction goes,
# whether tone belongs in the sentence, and what a comma does. It is not a
# grammar anyone could infer; it is a schema, and the app can simply emit it.
#
# No LLM. A closed vocabulary is a table, the structure is a form, and the
# user's own sentence is the one part that was never the problem. An LLM here
# would be a GPU cold start or an external key to do work a dict does.
#
# Two rules this whole section is built on:
#
# - **A pill is a word you did not have to guess.** Anything with a closed
#   vocabulary — camera, framing, lens, light, tone, action, foley, score —
#   is a pill, never a second box to type in. The prompt field keeps only what
#   nothing else can say: who is in the shot and what happens.
# - **No pills, no document.** With nothing chosen the compiler returns the
#   typed text byte-for-byte, so this is strictly additive: every prompt that
#   worked yesterday is still exactly what reaches the encoder. The document
#   only appears once you have said something that needs one.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Verbatim from the base guide. These are a contract with the checkpoint rather
# than phrasing we chose, so they are quoted exactly and not tidied — including
# the guide's own inconsistency, which is worth knowing about before someone
# "fixes" it: i2va and l2va bracket their labels (`<Picture 1>`, `[Shot 1]`)
# and fl2va does not. Both spellings are the guide's, in the same file.
#
# `S.SS` is the clip length the composer already knows, so it is filled rather
# than left literal — a placeholder that reaches the encoder is a placeholder
# the encoder conditions on.

# The vocabulary itself.
#
# `phrase` is the exact wording that gets written, so a pill teaches the
# phrasing it produces rather than standing in for it — "slow push-in", "stable
# rear tracking shot". Camera phrases in particular carry the guide's three
# required dimensions (motion type + amplitude + speed) because a bare "push in"
# is the half of a camera instruction H3 reads worst.
#
# Per group:
#   pick   "one" replaces within the group, "many" stacks. The guide is explicit
#          that a clip gets one camera move unless the timing is spelled out,
#          and framing and angle are single-valued by physics.
#   join   "list" folds into one comma-separated sentence; "sentence" stands
#          alone. This is where the punctuation question is answered once, in
#          code, instead of being guessed per prompt.
#   slot   position relative to the typed sentence, which sits at 0. Camera goes
#          last because the guide's rule is to describe the move after the thing
#          it is moving around. Groups that share a slot share a sentence, which
#          is why framing, angle, light and tone are all at -10: they are four
#          groups on the palette because that is how you pick them, and one
#          clause in the document because that is how a shot is described.

#          the keyframes/references row. Nothing dims today, because H3 reads
#          every group; it is the column a second family would arrive on. An

#   `retention_analysis` as one line per label with a fixed relationship marker

# None of those is a sentence anybody could be expected to write. All of them
# are facts an interface knows: a cut time is a boundary between two rows, a
# speaker ID is a cast member with a line, a retention line is the set of shots
# a handle appears in.
#

    Importable from the CPU web container for the same reason `_validate_shot`
    is. What it adds over that one is the class of error a pill rail cannot
    have: a cast member pointing at a picture nobody uploaded, a handle used in
    a shot that names nobody, a voice file dropped on a face. Every one of those
    compiles to a *valid* document that quietly says the wrong thing, which is
    the failure this whole layer exists to remove.

    Returns None for "no scene", which is not an error — it is the degrade, and
    the flat typed+pills path stays exactly as it was.

    `<Subject N>` by cast id — and only for cast that carry a reference.

    A subject label is a claim that something in the target video comes from an
    uploaded asset. Somebody described in the prose and nowhere else is not one,
    and giving them a label points the model at a picture that does not exist.

    **Numbered by order of first mention, not by the order the cast was built
    in.** These are different films:

        two men fight inside a corridor that is constantly rotating
        a spinning corridor bounces two men around as they fight

    Same three subjects, same world, same photographs. What differs is which
    noun the sentence opens on — and in the second one the men are not even
    agents, they are things that get bounced. Nobody has to be asked which the
    scene is *about*, because the sentence already said, and `[Shot N]` is read
    in order top to bottom. Numbering off the cast array threw that away and
    handed `<Subject 1>` to whoever happened to be created first, which on the
    composer is whichever `@` you typed first *anywhere* — so writing shot two
    before shot one silently inverted it.

    Anyone visible but never mentioned still gets a number, appended in cast
    order: a location carrying an establishing photograph earns a subject label
    without any line naming it, and so does a character who only ever speaks.

    `shots` is optional so the ordering is a refinement rather than a
    precondition — a caller with no timeline still gets the old, stable answer
    instead of an exception.

# Marks on a floor and a camera looking at them, and the sentences that fall
# out. This is the one thing in the composer that is *not* a vocabulary: no
# pill can say `she stands behind him, turned three-quarters away from the
# lens`, and across all 77 items in SHOT_VOCAB there is no way to say a subject
# is behind, beside, facing away, or screen left. The only place a subject is
# ever named in output is the hardcoded `<Subject 1>` in `_shot_text`.
#
# **Blocking does not add a vocabulary. It drives the one that exists.**
# Framing, angle and the camera move are *derived* here and fold through
# `_shot_phrases` exactly as a clicked pill would — an explicitly chosen pill
# still wins, because a person overriding a derivation is a person who has
# looked at it. What is genuinely new is only what geometry alone can say:
# where in the frame, how far back, which way they face, and how they stand to
# each other.
#
# The precedent is already shipping on the image side — `_compose_caption`
# turns rectangles into prose, and `_box_framing` already treats box height as
# a depth proxy. That is an approximated pinhole camera in production; this is
# the real relation.

# from the origin, `y` height. `yaw` in degrees, 0 looking along +z, clockwise

    """
    The same pills as prose, because Krea 2 has no document to fill in.

    Action and the two audio groups never reach here at all — they are filtered
    by `image` in the vocabulary rather than dropped, so a pill the image side
    does not read is dim on the palette rather than silently ignored.

    **Nothing precedes the subject.** Whatever occupies the opening clause is
    what the picture is *about*: the model reads front to back, and a property
    promoted to that position stops being a property and becomes the character.
    One mechanic, three faces — light in the lead makes a picture of the light,
    which is a real thing to want in an abstract render; perspective in the lead
    makes a picture of perspective, which reads as wild overcorrection when
    someone wanted a slight angle; and a *compiler* that leads with either makes
    that choice on nobody's behalf.

    This used to do all three, and the accumulation was the worst of it. All
    four image groups shared slot -10, so every pill landed ahead of the subject
    and they **stacked**: light and tone are both `pick: many`, so a framing, an
    angle, three lights and two tones put seven clauses in front of the person,
    who arrived last. The first repair was a split performed here — one clause
    leads, the rest fall behind — which still promoted one thing and chose it by
    vocabulary order, so with framing and angle unset the winner was light.

    The fix belongs in the vocabulary, and both sides turned out to want the
    same thing: light and tone at 30, framing and angle at 40 beside the camera
    move. Video already had `camera` at 40 for the reason H3's guide gives —
    describe the move after the thing it moves around — and that principle
    covers the frame it moves *within* just as well, so there is one slot table
    rather than a per-side exception. Nothing is left here to arrange.

    Framing's phrases moved with its slot. They were noun phrases ("a medium
    close-up"), which read correctly only when *fused* into a subject noun —
    "An extreme close-up portrait" — and this machinery cannot fuse, it
    appositions. So the one arrangement where leading is right was the one it
    could never produce, while a demoted "A medium close-up." is a bare
    fragment. "in a medium close-up" reads alone and reads joined to an angle.

#
# The deployed URL is `{workspace}--visionary-web.modal.run`. That is derived
# from names rather than generated, so it is guessable by anyone who knows the
# workspace, and behind it sit the volume — photographs of real people, and
# LoRAs trained on them — and a Generate button that rents an H100 on the
# account's card. Obscurity was never the gate; there was no gate.
#
# One password, because the app is singular by construction: `sessions`, `jobs`
# and the volume layout have no tenant in them, and an auth layer that implied
# otherwise would be the first half of a multi-tenant rewrite nobody asked for.
#
# Three properties of what is already here chose the mechanism, and all three
# are load-bearing:
#
#   Six routes serve bytes straight into <img src> and <video src> — thumb,
#   image, clip, file, cover, character-file. A browser attaches no headers to
#   those, so a bearer token cannot reach them. It is a cookie or it is nothing.
#
#   /api/status is polled every 400ms for the length of a training run. A
#   session looked up in a Modal Dict would put a network round trip on that
#   path, which is the `_active_download()` failure again — a Dict scan there
#   took a route from milliseconds to seven seconds. So the cookie carries its
#   own proof: an HMAC this container verifies against a secret it already
#   holds, no network at all.
#
#   web() is max_containers=1, which makes in-process memory effectively
#   global. That is what lets the secret cache and the attempt counter below be
#   two module-level variables rather than shared state.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Its own Dict, deliberately not `config`. The recovery path for a forgotten

        A page of everything on the volume, newest first — no job id required.

        `stale` used to mean "this listing may be missing the run you just
        made". It cannot mean that any more: `_output_entries` asks Modal
        rather than the mount, so the *set* is right whether or not a reload
        landed. What a refused reload still costs is the mount — the sidecars
        read below, and the covers this reply is about to send the page after.
        So `stale` now means: **the mount is behind this listing, so the newest

        once it has stopped loading pictures. Not an error, and not something
        to apologise for on screen.

        `limit` is clamped rather than trusted: the sidecar read is per item,
        so an unbounded page is an unbounded number of file reads on a route
        anyone can call.

        No reload, and no `_reload_insist` sleeping in the handler: every part
        of this listing — the entry set, the mtimes, the sidecars — now comes
        off committed state by RPC, and the covers the page asks for next are
        served off the spool the same way. `stale` is kept in the reply for
        the page that still reads it, and it is now always false, because

        pulled the volume forward so the canvas's first /api/file would not
        miss, insisting through refusals with up to half a second of sleep on
        the hot poll path. Retired with the mount, not just moved: the pixels
        are served off the spool from committed state now, so the first ask
        for a fresh run cannot miss, and nothing in the serving path needs a
        reload to happen at all.
